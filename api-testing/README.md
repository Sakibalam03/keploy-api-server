# Employee Management System - Testing Documentation

This document provides comprehensive testing information for the Employee Management System, covering both unit tests and integration tests. The testing suite ensures code quality, functionality verification, and database interaction validation for the Flask RESTful API backend.

## Testing Overview

The testing suite for this Employee Management System is designed to ensure robust functionality and reliability through two complementary testing approaches:

* **Unit Testing:** Tests individual components and functions in isolation using mocking to simulate external dependencies.
* **Integration Testing:** Tests the complete system interaction between the Flask API and MySQL database with real data operations.

Both test suites use Python's built-in `unittest` framework for consistency and minimal external dependencies.

## Unit Testing

### Test Coverage

The unit testing suite achieves **82% code coverage** on the main application (`app.py`), exceeding the required 70% threshold. Coverage includes:

* API endpoint functionality
* Input validation and error handling
* Database connection management
* Request/response processing

### Dependencies

Unit tests use only built-in Python libraries:

* `unittest` (built-in testing framework)
* `unittest.mock` (for mocking external dependencies)
* `json` (for JSON data handling)
* `sys` (for module mocking)

**Optional dependency for coverage reporting:**
```bash
pip install coverage
